This is a quick demo, showing how to create a Java web-service in just a few minutes. I'm assuming you have Java and Tomcat already installed on you computer and use IntelliJ as your IDE, and [gradle](https://gradle.org) as your build-automation system.

The simple task is to create a web-service that can answer if a provided number is even or odd. So for example, you would type _"http://localhost:8080/eo/evenORodd?x=3"_ into the URL address input field of your browser, and then see something like this as the result: **3 is odd **

Not all that sophisticated, I know that, but that's not the point.
